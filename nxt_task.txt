We will be adding a new jobs model with titles, companies, start_years, and end_years fields. In one timeframe one user can hold only one job. Start year and end year has a relation of [x,y) which means (2020-2021, 2021-2021,2021-) is valid but (2020-2021,2020-2022) is not. If no end year, then it is his current job. User can have only one currnet job at a time. If a new job is entered, the old job's end year will automatically be the same as the start year of the new one providing that it holds all the validation.
Endpoints:
/api/job -> add new job
/api/job/current -> displays current job
/api/job/history -> displays all the jobs of current user with detail (sorted).

Look at sqlalchemy relationship, foreign keys.
Optimize number of queries executed.
Get username from jwt token during decorator validation. So that one user can't upload another ones data.
